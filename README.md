This repository contains benchmark instances for the aircraft conflict resolution problem (ACRP) in air traffic control.

The two-dimensional (2D) ACRP consists of finding minimal deviation trajectories for a set of aircraft in a plane by adjusting aircraft velocities (speed and heading) within specified control bounds. The main decision variables of the 2D ACRP are the speed control rate and the heading control deviation of aircraft. 

The 2D ACRP can be represented as a nonconvex mixed-integer problem. Details on this formulation can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12997
