Data for the Circle Problem (CP).

In instance CP_n, n aircraft are uniformly located on the circumference of a circle and heading towards its centre. All aircraft are assumed to have the same speed and be at the same altitude.

Illustration of instance CP_7: black dots represent aircraft initial positions.

CP instances have been widely used in the ACRP literature, see notably Vanaret et al. (2012). The CP instances of this repository have been used by Rey and Hijazi (2017) and Dias et al. (2020).
