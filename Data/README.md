Benchmarking data for the ACRP. All problem instances are in AMPL format.

__CP__ contains Circle Problem instances  
__FP__ contains Flow Problem instances  
__GP__ contains Grid Problem instances  
__RCP__ contrains Random Circle Problem instances  

All instances are designed based on a circular structure and aircraft are positioned relative to the circle. All instances contain the following data (NM stands for Nautical Mile):

_n_ number of aircraft  
_v0_ aircraft initial speed in (NM/h)/100  
_cap_ aircraft initial heading  
_x0_ aircraft initial x-coordinate  
_y0_ aircraft initial y-coordinate  
_d_ separation norm in NM/100  
_radius_ radius of circle on which aircraft are initially located in NM/100
