Data for the Random Circle Problem (RCP).

RCP instances are randomized CP instances where aircraft speeds and headings are randomly deviated to create un-structured instances. RCP instances are named RCP_N_ID where N is the number of aircraft and ID is the identification of this instance.  

The archive __RCP_Instances__ contains data for the 2D ACRP.  
The archives __RCP_FL_Z_Instances__ contains data for the 2D+FL ACRP with a number of Z flight levels (FL). The parameter _nf_ indicates the number of FLs and the parameter _l0_ indicates aircraft initial FL.
