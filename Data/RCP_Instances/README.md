Data for the Random Circle Problem (RCP).

RCP instances are randomized CP instances where aircraft speeds and headings are randomly deviated to create unstructured instances. RCP instances are named RCP_N_ID where N is the number of aircraft and ID is the identification of this instance. RCP instances in this repository were generated by randomly deviating aircraft initial heading within the range [-PI/6,+PI/6] and randomly generating aircraft initial speeds in the range 486-594 NM/h.

The archive __RCP_Instances__ contains data for the 2D ACRP.  
The archives __RCP_FL_Z_Instances__ contains data for the 2D+FL ACRP with a number of Z flight levels (FL). The parameter _nf_ indicates the number of FLs and the parameter _l0_ indicates aircraft initial FL.

RCP instances have been introduced by Vanaret et al. (2012). The RCP instances of this repository have been used by Rey and Hijazi (2017) and Dias et al. (2020).
