Data for the Grid Problem (GP).

GP instances consists of two FP instances with a confluence angle of PI/2 diagonally spaced by 15 NM. In GP_m, four streams of m aircraft each converge towards the centre of their relative circle. The total number of aircraft is n=4*m.

GP instances have been widely used in the ACRP literature, see notably Vanaret et al. (2012). The GP instances of this repository have been used by Dias et al. (2020).
