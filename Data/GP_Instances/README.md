Data for the Grid Problem (GP).

GP instances consists of two FP instances with a confluence angle of PI/2 diagonally spaced by 15 NM. In GP_m, four streams of m aircraft each converge towards the centre of their relative circle. The total number of aircraft is n=4*m.

GP instances were proposed by Lehouillier et al. (2017). The GP instances of this repository are used in Dias et al. (2020).
