Data for the Flow Problem (FP). 

In instance FP_m, two streams of m aircraft each converge to the centre of the circle. The total number of aircraft is n=2*m. The angle of confluence between the two streams is PI/6. In each stream, aircraft are spaced by 15 NM.

FP instances were proposed by Lehouillier et al. (2017). The FP instances of this repository are used in Dias et al. (2020).
